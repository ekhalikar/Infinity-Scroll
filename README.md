# Infinity-Scroll
- The webpage pulls images from the [Unsplash Developer API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and shows them in a line where the user can scroll down to see each one.
- As the user reaches the bottom of the page, the website will automatically pull more images using the API so that the user never reaches the bottom 
of the page thus give the website the appearance of an Infinite Scroll. 
- The user can tell by the scrollbar getting smaller as it get closer to the
bottom and never actually reaching the bottom of the page.
